## Set Player

Play audio loops in web browser. React component, downloads playlist of elements. Use UI to mute/solo tracks. All tracks play at the same time. All tracks use ToneJS transport-based synchronization to ensure musical cohesion.

Written for React using TypeScript (enforcing strong types). Using Axios for API communication and React Hooks for triggers.
